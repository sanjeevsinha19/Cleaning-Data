# *Cleaning and Getting Data* course project

An analysis of accelerometer data generated from an experiment with Samsung Galaxy S smartphones.

### Contents

  - `CodeBook.md` - Describes the experiment data and the steps taken to summarize the data.
  - `run_analysis.R` - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the experiment data.
  - `cleanData.txt` - Output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.
  - `README.md` - This file.
# Tasks
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



### Getting started

  1. Read through the [CodeBook](CodeBook.md) and the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get a general understanding of this project, the steps taken in the analysis, and the output file.
  2. Make sure the [experiment data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) is downloaded and extracted to a folder in the project directory called `UCI HAR Dataset`.
  3. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.
